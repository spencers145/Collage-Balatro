### by AlrexX (Lucky6), Maxx, canicao, GARB and UHadMeAtFood

*Hey folks!* Today we're back with more **Rofflatro**, a vanilla-friendly mod made for streamer and content creator Roffle. This love letter to the community contains 30 new Jokers, a new Streamer Deck, and plenty of custom challenges, all referencing inside jokes in Roffle's chat and the Balatro community as a whole. *Enjoy the video!*
