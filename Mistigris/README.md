# Mistigris: Spicy, Yet Balanced!
> This mod is currently in early development! Most art has not yet been implemented, and things may be broken or unfinished!

Welcome to Mistigris! Inspired by the likes of Paperback, Ortalab and Maximus, this is a vanilla-style mod intended to bring new, spicy gimmicks and playstyles to Balatro, while ensuring there is still a sense of order and balance!

This mod currently has:
* **46** new Jokers
* **6** new Boss Blinds
* **3** new Decks

with more to come in the future!

* **[Join the Official Mistigris Discord!](<https://discord.gg/fjcBm5YmdN>)**
Keep up with development and chat with others who might like the mod!

## Compatibilities

> Mistigris has been specifically designed to be compatible with the following mods!

* [Talisman](<https://github.com/MathIsFun0/Talisman>): For really big numbers
* [Cryptid](<https://github.com/MathIsFun0/Cryptid>): For a dash of extra insanity in that mod.

## Install Guide
> Requires Steamodded 1.0.0~BETA-0323b (or newer) and Lovely 0.7.1 (or newer)
1. If you don't have Steamodded, be sure to install that first before proceeding any further! (Guide available [here](<https://github.com/Steamodded/smods/wiki>))
2. Download the Mistigris source code through [this link](<https://github.com/astrapboy/Mistigris/archive/refs/heads/main.zip>).
3. Navigate to your mod folder, based on what your operating system is.

	* ```Windows: %AppData%/Balatro/Mods```

	* ```Mac: ~/Library/Application Support/Balatro/Mods```

	* ```Linux (WINE/Proton): ~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/2379780/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/AppData/Roaming/Balatro/Mods```

4. Open the Mistigris-main.zip file, and move the "Mistigris-main" into your mods directory.
	* **Make sure it's not a nested folder! (i.e. Mistigris-main -> Mistigris-main)**

5. Enjoy!

**It's highly recommended to play mods on a *separate* profile, to not disrupt or interfere with your Vanilla save progress.**
