# __**Ortalab**__

It's Balatro as you know it, but backwards, and sideways, as if the game was designed in an alternate universe. Simply put, it's Balatro backwards.
And thus, Ortalab!
 
With 150 new jokers, 20 new challenges, 8 new stakes, more than 50 new consumables, and way, WAY more, Ortalab is practically a sequel to Balatro.
 
Get ready to find new strategies, blow the game out of the water,
and maybe not die to The Plant for once.
 
Have fun
