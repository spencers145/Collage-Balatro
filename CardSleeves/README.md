A Steamodded+lovely Balatro Mod that adds Sleeves.

![Balatro_Card_Sleeves](Balatro_Card_Sleeves.png)

# Requirements
Requires `steamodded >= 1.0.0~ALPHA-1206c` - [link](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods/wiki).

Requires `Lovely >= 0.6.0` - [link](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector). This should already be installed as part of steamodded's installation process.

# Installation
Get the latest stable version from the [Releases](https://github.com/larswijn/CardSleeves/releases/latest), then download and extract the zip.
Or use `git clone` for the latest development code, which is more up-to-date, but might be unstable.

Make sure to put the `CardSleeves` folder in the `Mods` directory, and that it is not nested.

# Features
Sleeves are run modifiers similar to decks. Any deck and sleeve can be combined.

CardSleeves adds 15 Sleeves by default, some of which have an unique and different effect when paired with their corresponding deck:
| Sleeve           | Base effect                                            | Unique effect                                                          |
