# Glue For Modpacks V.0.0.4
 Balatro Mod to add utilities that may make playing with multiple content mods more enjoyable. Currently, the scope is small, but if other additions seem beneficial, those will be added too.
 - Change the # of slots of shop areas
 - Change the # of joker/consumable slots
 - Change the default spawn rate of jokers (useful if many mods add consumable types that their combined rates start to dwarf the joker rate)
 - Change the rarity chances

# How To Use
By default, the added slots for all factors will be set to 0. You can change these in the mod config. The Joker rate is the percentage of cards that will be a joker in the shop.

# Additional Info
By default the joker chances are set to be about 70% of the items spawning in the shop when you have no vouchers that increase any odds. At 70%, the chances of a shop containing a joker are 91% by default. 

If you want to not keep the chances of jokers spawning per shop slot, but the chances of jokers spawning per reroll, set it instead to one of the following chances, depending on how many item slots the shop will have by default:
- 3 slots: 0.56
- 4 slots: 0.45
- 5 slots: 0.38
