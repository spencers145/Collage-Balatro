# Virtues
10 Suit focused Jokers, 4 of which can grow quickly, but are risky and require you to keep them in mind.

This mod attempts to keep the balance close to vanilla, but this is an early stage, so might be unbalanced.

It has something similar to a hidden questline to find a legendary.

Haven't looked at any compatibility for other mods, but I think it's kept good practice and doesn't do anything insane, so it shouldn't cause too many issues.

## Requires the Steamodded 1.0.0 Alpha.
