A Balatro mod to disable specific Jokers, consumables, and more from randomly appearing in-game.

In the collection, you can right-click on an item to **disable** it, or you can press **Disable All** to disable **all** cards in the selected category (or every category, if you're in the main collection screen).

Using this mod, nearly all content from installed mods can be cherry-picked, if there are some Jokers you'd like to have but not others, or if you don't want the mod to add any new Blinds. Using the **Disable All** button inside a mod's Additions tab will disable only that mod's content.
